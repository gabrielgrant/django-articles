This is a very basic article app, which I use as a class to extend in
a number of places. It uses several other django apps that I've built.


Installation

add django-articles and its dependencies to the installed_apps list:

- static_filtered_images
- ckeditor
- ckeditor_filemodel_manager
- articles

add a resize setting:

 ARTICLE_IMAGE_RESIZE = {'width':280, 'style':"=="}
